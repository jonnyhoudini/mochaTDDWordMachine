#ASTRAK Software Developer coding challenge

=== THE BRIEF ===

Using a language of your choice, create a short script which takes in a string value and represents the length of that string as a written number.

For example : 
INPUT: testing OUTPUT: seven 
INPUT: Astrak OUTPUT: six
INPUT: Education OUTPUT: nine

The limit should be 15, beyond this limit a reasonable response should be output

For additional challenge : 

If the majority of the word is uppercase your response should also be uppercase otherwise it should be all lowercase within the response.

For example : 

INPUT: testinG OUTPUT: seven 
INPUT: ASTRAK OUTPUT: SIX
INPUT: EducATIon OUTPUT: nine
